hEY so i know there's an extra _ at the end of some of the names!!! don't remove them!!!!

i googled this and nothing came up but essentially: i accidentally named something the wrong thing
(for ex put it at the wrong difficulty) so i renamed it to the righ thing, easy peasy. but then!
when it was time to use the name that scene previous had (ie now i was actually making something
of that difficulty) using that previously used name would just?? replace the new scene with the other
scene?? i have tried all methods of deletion and renaming, can't figure it out, thus i just made new
names with the extra _

if u know a fix let me know

otherwise just leave 'em be
