1sm_1_1 two of the mirrors are not required
1SM_2_1 you can cut off the laser from the beginning directly towards the receiver
2SM_1_2 same issue as 1SM_2_1
2SM_1_3 the two sided mirror is not required
(Good use of two sided mirror in 2SM_2_1)
(I really like 2SM_2_2)
2SM_2_3 it is possible to avoid using the two sided mirror
2SM_3_1 can be completed without using 1 two sided mirror and 2 one sided mirrors
C&P_1_3 You can avoid the pre-placed mirrors for the most part by directing the laser upwards before the first mirror
(I like the use of receiver ranges in 1WM_1_3)
(Amazing use of one way mirrors in 1WM_2_1)
1WM_2_2 can be completed without one of the one sided mirrors
1WM_2_3 can be completed without one of the one sided mirrors. I would recommend removing one as it is a pretty interesting solution without one, though I haven't see the original solution.
1WM_3_1 can be completed without one of the one sided mirrors
(good use of blocks and tiles in 1WM_3_2)
1WM_3_3 can be completed without one of the one sided mirrors

===Second review section===
(I like 1WM_4_1 because the obvious solutions to me required more mirrors)
(I'm liking the difficulty of these levels. Your designation of the difficulty levels is great)
1WM_4_3 can be completed without one of the one sided mirrors. The solution seemed to easy, so adding tiles might help.
1WM_5_1 feels a little to strait forward for me. Maybe move stuff around a little and add a 2 sided mirror somewhere.
(P_1_3 is a really good use of unmoveable objects. love it!)
P_2_2 can be completed without one of the two way mirrors. Also, the use of the greater than mode on the receiver seems to be pointless and just confused me.
P_2_3 can be completed without the two way mirror
P_3_1 can be completed without one of the one way mirrors (I would remove the mirrors from this and the previous one and swap them)
(P_3_2 was pretty interesting to think about the power levels)
(I like the use of the locked mirror in P_3_3 because the level makes you use it)
P_4_1 is good, though I found an interesting solution if you remove one prism and and add one more one way mirror. (Finally finished that level after like 10 minutes with what you gave me, and I found a solution that doesn't use two of the one sided mirrors (surprised myself). I still don't know what your solution is lol)
P_4_2 is possible without 1 one sided mirror and 1 one way mirror
