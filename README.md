# Laser Lab

This is a simple laser puzzle game built in Unity. As of 3/27/20, project is still in progress, and no build is available for easy download and review. This will be remedied as progress is made; project is near completion. 

## Download & Testing

Currently, downloading all files and running through Unity is the only way to test the project. A proper release of the game will happen after the project's completion, at which point this document will be updated to include a link to download the game.

## Current Game State

As of 3/27/20, the project is nearing completion with all scripts, GUI, level, art and sound design done. Remaining work is creating the paths between levels, testing all created levels, and final publication. The following is a brief documentation of how the game works.

The user is shown a board with at least one laser and at least one receiver. The aim of the game is to direct the laser to the receiver using the variety of board pieces the user has at their disposal. 

Simple pieces, such as one sided mirrors, two sided mirrors, blocks, and tiles all do as expected. 



More complex pieces, such as prisms, two way mirrors, one way mirrors, and diffraction grids help the user to split up the power or colors of the laser, should the receiver have special requirements it needs met.



Depending on the level, pieces can be restricted by only allowing certain forms of user interraction, such as limitations on movement and rotation. Pieces can also be set to already be placed upon level load-in, creating obstacles for the user.
